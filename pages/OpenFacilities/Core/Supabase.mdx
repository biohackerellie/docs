# Supabase / Postgres Database

## Why Supabase?

While this project does need a database, its really up to the developer to choose what they want to use. Because I made this project using an ORM, it should be easy to switch to another database if you want to. But I decided to use Postgres, and as I was designing this app for a school district I knew I would eventually no longer work for, I wanted to make sure that the database was easy to use and maintain.

So that's where Supabase comes in. Supabase is a Postgres database that is hosted on the cloud, and it has a lot of features that make it easy to use. It has a built in API, so you can make requests to the database from the front end. It also has a built in authentication system, so you can easily add users to the database and restrict access to certain tables. It also has a built in storage system, so you can store files in the database. And it has a lot of other features that make it easy to use.
