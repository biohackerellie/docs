# Configure your email provider

No matter which way you decide to install BunMail, you will need to configure your email settings.
Bunmail currently only supports Gmail, but more providers will be added in the future, feel free to contribute!. To set up gmail, you will need to do the following:

    1. Your Api Key
    2. The email address you want to send from
    3. Your email password(*if you aren't using oauth*)

    	*if you are using Oauth*

    4. Your client id
    5. Your client secret
    6. Your refresh token
    7. Your Access Token.

Additionally, you will need to enable less secure apps in your gmail settings. You can do this by going to your gmail settings, and clicking on the "Accounts and Import" tab. Then, click on "Other Google Account Settings". This will open a new tab. Click on "Security" in the left sidebar. Scroll down until you see "Less Secure App Access". Click on "Turn On Access". You should now be able to send emails from BunMail.

If you are using Oauth for added security, you can find out how to configure your client id and tokens from this [article](https://docs.emailengine.app/setting-up-gmail-oauth2-for-imap-api/?utm_source=nodemailer&utm_campaign=nodemailer&utm_medium=oauth-link)
