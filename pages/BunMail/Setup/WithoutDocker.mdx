# Without Docker

Alternatively, you can run the server without Docker. The following snippet is for Unix-based systems, but it will also work on Mac-OS and Windows with some modifications.

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/biohackerellie/Bunmail.git
   ```
2. Install Bun and the dependencies
   ```bash
   cd Bunmail \
   # Install Bun
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash && \
   # Install dependencies
   bun install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file based on the provided `env.example` and fill in your own values.

4. Run the server
   ```bash
   bun run ./index.ts
   ```
