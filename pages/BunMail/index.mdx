Hey there, welcome to BunMail! This is a nifty little email server designed to securely
send emails via POST requests. Plus, it's built on Bun! Cool, right?

## What You'll Need

### Server

BunMail is pretty light, <Callout emoji="ðŸš€"> **Less than 500mb!!!** </Callout> and can be run on almost any platform that can run a node server like Docker(preffered), Rasberry Pi, or even a VPS.

### API Key

You will need to generate your own API key. You can do this by running the following
command:

<GenerateHex>```openssl rand -hex 32 ```</GenerateHex>

### Email Provider

You will also need to set up an email provider. Bunmail runs nodemailer under the hood, so its highly suggested you use gmail, but you can use any email provider that nodemailer supports. Learn more about nodemailer configuration [here](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/).

## ðŸ’Œ How to Send Emails

Once you've got Bunmail up and running, sending emails is easy!

Send a POST request to `http://localhost:6969/email` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
	"key": "Your-API-Key-Here",
	"to": "recipient@example.com",
	"from": "sender@example.com",
	"subject": "Hello, World!",
	"html": "<h1>Hi there!</h1>"
}
```

If everything's set up correctly, you'll get a sweet message back saying "Email Sent Successfully" ðŸŽ‰.
