# Jellyfin / Plex

This guide will show you how to install both Jellyfin and Plex as they are both very similar.

## Jellyfin or Plex? Why I chose Jellyfin

### Jellyfin

#### Pros

- Free
- Open Source
- No ads
- No tracking
- No account required
- No internet connection required
- No subscription required

#### Cons

- No official app for many devices like smart TVs
- The official app is inconsistent and buggy on some devices like game consoles
- Doesn't always play nice when sharing outside your network

### Plex

#### Pros

- Official app for many devices like smart TVs
- The official app is consistent and stable on most devices like game consoles
- Plays nice when sharing outside your network

#### Cons

- Many features are locked behind a subscription like offline sync, parental controls, live TV, and Hardware Transcoding
- Ads
- Tracking
- Account required
- Internet connection required

Both apps are great and I recommend trying both to see which one you like better. I personally use Jellyfin because I don't like the idea of my media being tracked and I don't like the idea of paying for features that should be free. Especially when it comes to the nature of how we sailors of the high seas acquire our media, the future is uncertain with using plex, but with Jellyfin, I don't have to worry about that.

## Media Directories

Here, you will see the benefits of using a network nfs share for your VMS. We will be creating directories here in the share that all of our vms will be able to access. Without a shared filesystem, you would have to be copying media files between VMs and that is not ideal. A network share doesn't have to come from a NAS, you can even set up a network share directly from your super mega awesome gaming pc, look up NFS share on windows and you'll find a guide on how to do it. But I will be using my TrueNAS server for this guide and there will be a later on section on how to set up a NFS share on TrueNAS.

### Create the directories

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/server/{movies,tv,anime,downloads}
```

this will create all the folders you need for your media in the network share, you can add more directories if you'd like to get more specific, but both apps also have built in playlist capabilities so you can just make a playlist for whatever you want.

Now lets go back to Dockge and make the containers.

## Quick note on Docker Compose files

Before we create the file for either Jellyfin or Plex, there are some key things to note about docker compose.

When you make a file, and are setting things to your needs, like the directory path of your folders, or the ports, you'll see the lines on the compose file look like this:

```yaml
ports:
	- "1000:1000"
```

whenever specifying variables like ports or paths etc, there is always a colon : between 2 values. The value on the left side of the colon is the one you want to change, the one specific to your host vm. The value on the right side of the colon is specific to the application and cannot be changed. So in the example above, if you wanted the app to be on port 6969, you would set it like `6969:1000`.

## Jellyfin

In Dockge click on the `+Compose` button

Name the stack Jellyfin and make sure the Dockge Agent is on the current, primary, ip and in the top textbox on the right, delete everything inside and paste in the following, with any changes you need to make to the ports and paths:

```yaml
version: '2.1'
services:
  jellyfin:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:latest # The application image
    container_name: jellyfin
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/Denver # Replace with your timezone
      - JELLYFIN_PublishedServerUrl=10.50.1.4 # Replace with your VMs IP address
    volumes:
      - /mnt/server/tv:/data/tvshows
      - /mnt/server/anime:/data/anime
      - /mnt/server/downloads:/data/downloads
      - /mnt/server/movies:/data/movies
    ports:
      - 8096:8096
      - 8920:8920
      - 7359:7359/udp
      - 1900:1900/udp
    restart: unless-stopped # This line ensures the container restarts if the VM is restarted, unless you manually stop the container
```

Once you have made the changes you need, click the `Deploy` button and wait for it to finish. Once it's done, you can go to `http://<your VMs IP>:8096` and you should see the Jellyfin setup page. Follow the setup and you should be good to go.
Jellyfin will automatically scan the directories you set up and after a few minutes you should find all of your media in the library. For more indepth setup, like adding users, installing addons, etc, check out the [Jellyfin Docs](https://jellyfin.org/docs)

## Plex

Plex has one more step then Jellyfin, you need to get a claim token from Plex to use the app. You can make your account and get one [here](https://www.plex.tv/claim/). Once you have the token, you can make the compose file.

In Dockge click on the `+Compose` button

Name the stack Plex and make sure the Dockge Agent is on the current, primary, ip and in the top textbox on the right, delete everything inside and paste in the following, with any changes you need to make to the ports and paths:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  plex:
    container_name: plex
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/plex:latest # The application image
    network_mode: host
    restart: unless-stopped # This line ensures the container restarts if the VM is restarted, unless you manually stop the container
    ports:
      - 32400:32400/tcp

    environment:
	  - PUID=1000
	  - PGID=1000
	  - VERSION=docker
      - TZ=America/Denver # Replace with your timezone
      - PLEX_CLAIM=claim--<your claim token here>
    volumes:
      - /mnt/server/tv:/tv
      - /mnt/server/anime:/anime
      - /mnt/server/movies:/movies
```

Once you have made the changes you need, click the `Deploy` button and wait for it to finish. Once it's done, you can go to `http://<your VMs IP>:32400/web` and you should see the Plex setup page. Follow the setup and you should be good to go.
Plex will automatically scan the directories you set up and after a few minutes you should find all of your media in the library.
