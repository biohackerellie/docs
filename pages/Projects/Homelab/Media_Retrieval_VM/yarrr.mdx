# Prowlarr/Sonarr/Radarr

These apps are all created by the same developer and all share a similar interface. So I'll just cover them all here, You'll want to open all 3 apps.

## Prowlarr

### Indexers

Starting with Prowlarr, you'll want to start by adding the sites you'll want to search.

From the main page, the Indexers tab, click the big plus button to add a new indexer. Add whichever you want, i'd filter by Protocal: Torrent and Privacy: Public. I'd recommend adding at least 3-4 indexers, but don't add too many, as it'll slow down your searches. For legal reasons, I can't recommend any specific indexers, but you can find all your favorites like the bay of pirates and kick booty torrents, if you know what I mean.

The settings for these 2 apps are almost identical, so I'll just cover them both here. The only difference will be the root folders.
